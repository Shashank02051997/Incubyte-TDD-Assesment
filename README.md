# Incubyte-TDD-Assesment

## How TDD work?
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write tests before writing the actual code:

Write a failing test case that describes the desired functionality.
Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.
Refactor the code to improve its structure while ensuring the test continues to pass.
Repeat steps 1-3 for each new piece of functionality.
TDD helps ensure code quality, maintainability, and that software meets its requirements.
